Type "n", "s", "w", or "e" to move from location to location. Commands that are currently
implemented include: GET, TAKE, DROP, INVENTORY (i), GO [dir], LOOK, EXAMINE, VERBOSE [on/off].
As of 12/17/2002, background audio is implemented in the Foyer, Loading Zone, and Ballroom areas.
Currently the sounds try to load in the background so dialup users may not hear them start
immediately. (Click to see <a href="example1.html">GUI PROTOTYPE</a>.)

<p>If this doesn't work, you are probably using a Windows PC. Sun is currently suing Microsoft for
them shipping old version of Java so it makes it appear that Java does not work.  You can download
and install the latest Java for Windows <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">here</a>.
