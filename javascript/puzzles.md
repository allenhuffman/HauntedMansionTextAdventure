# Haunted Mansion Adventure Game Ideas #

Here are some ideas for the types of puzzles that might end up in the game. It might be fun to have thirteen puzzles to solve to win the game.

The new game engine has actions that can do things like make an object appear in the room ("search bushes", "you found a sneaker!"), make a new exit appear ("unlock door"), or teleport to new locations ("climb tree"). They can have requirements ("open door" requires "key").

# Objectives #
1. One "win" would simply be to find 13 specific Haunted Mansion-related items in the game, like a treasure hunt.
2. More advanced would be trying to solve a series of puzzles that allow the player to "escape" the Mansion. Ideally, there would be several ways to do this so if a player got stuck, they could try another approach. It would also offer a bit of replyability.

# Puzzles #

## Secret Entrance ##
A Secret Entrance in the crypt area leads directly to the Portrait Corridor, bypassing the foryer and stretching room. This could use something from the comic. "In the comic story "The Pickwick Capers", the Pun Crypts contain a secret entrance into the Mansion that opens when pressing a button on the "M.T. Tomb" crypt."

## Stretching Room ##
Upon entering from the foyer, there is no way out ("no windows, and no doors".) Some puzzle can "activate" the stretch room (teleport to a separate location) that then has the exits available.

## Master Gracey's Bedchamber ##
A locked door with a key needed.

## Spellbook ##
Madame Leota's spellbook can be used to...

## Bookmark ##
Found in a book from the library, the bookmark can be used to...

## Portraits ##
A hidden safe behind a portrait. Some clue to know which portrait it will be. "April" is a good once, since there can be a calendar somewhere with a not on it, and April circled on the page or something. The safe can contain some item needed elsewhere.

## Rope to the Cemetary ##
A ladder can be used to get to the rafters of the stretch room (the one where the ceiling has disappeared and the body is hanging). There could be extra rope there which could be used to lower down from the ledge in the attic to the cemetary.

## Alcove in the Grand Hall ##
The area behind the curtain (only open during Haunted Mansion Holiday) can be a secret location revealed with some kind of Christmas-related puzzle.

## Chicken ##
The rubber chicken could be taken to the "exit" to win the game or at least get something special needed elsewhere ;-) Chicken Exit.

## Rose ##
The rose always left on the tombstone outside the WDW mansion could be an item. Maybe the conservatory flowers could be removed and a fresh rose placed there, which would make something happen.

## Bright Lights ##
The famous spiel mention ghosts are "frightfully sensative to bright lights." There should be a room full of ghosts, but bringing in a source of bright light causes them to stop, then you can go somewhere from there.

## Madame Leota can help... ##
The dialog that was restored, then removed, mentioned that "they all have trouble getting through. Perhaps Madame Leota can help..." Something tied to that line where you use her crystal ball?

## 1969 and 1971 ##
Perhaps some calendar reference to the year each haunted mansion opened? Could be the combination to the safe behind the portrait.

## Playful spirits... ##
It would be fun to do something related to the breakdown spiel.
